# Building Entry Controller System - QNX Neutrino

## Overview

This project is a simulation of a building entry controller system designed as part of the CST8244 - Real-Time Programming course. The system manages the entry and exit of individuals through a controlled two-door system using card scanners, a scale to weigh individuals, and manual guard-operated locks. The project is implemented in C and runs on the QNX Neutrino RTOS. The system is designed to handle multiple tasks concurrently, including card scanning, weight measurement, and door control, while ensuring real-time responsiveness and data integrity.

The project demonstrates the use of **semaphores**, **message passing** via `MsgSend`, `MsgReceive`, and `MsgReply` functions, **shared memory**, **channels** for inter-process communication, and **state machine design** to synchronize tasks and manage state transitions. Additionally, the project incorporates **concurrent processing** and **process synchronization** to ensure real-time operation.

## System Components

- **Card Scanners**: Located at each door, used to scan a unique personal ID card.
- **Doors**: Two doors (left and right) that control access to the building. Each door is self-closing but not self-locking.
- **Weight Scale**: Measures the weight of the person after they enter the space between the two doors.
- **Human Guard**: Manages the unlocking and locking of each door via a switch.

## Project Components

The project consists of three primary programs, each responsible for a specific aspect of the building entry controller system:

- **`des_display`**: Displays the status of the system, showing which door is open/closed and other relevant information. This program runs in the background and prints status updates to the console. It responds to state changes managed by the `des_controller` program.

- **`des_controller`**: The core program that runs the state machine for the building entry controller system. It manages persistent data and state transitions, handling inputs from the `des_inputs` program and sending status updates to the `des_display` program. The main logic for the entry control system resides in the `des_controller/des_controller.c` file, while the shared data structures and constants used across the programs are defined in the `des_controller/des.h` file.

- **`des_inputs`**: Simulates input events from the devices (e.g., card readers, door latches, scale). It prompts the user for inputs and sends them as messages to the `des_controller` program. The command-line interface for simulating various input events is implemented in the `des_inputs/des_inputs.c` file.

## Technologies and Concepts Used

- **QNX Neutrino RTOS**: The real-time operating system used to run the project.
- **C Programming Language**: The language used to implement the project.
- **Message Passing**: Used for communication between processes via `MsgSend`, `MsgReceive`, and `MsgReply`.
- **Semaphores**: Employed to manage synchronization between processes.
- **Shared Memory**: Used to share data between different processes.
- **State Machine Design**: Implements the logic for the entry control system, managing state transitions.
- **Concurrent Processing**: Ensures multiple tasks are handled simultaneously.
- **Channels**: Used for inter-process communication to pass messages between processes.

## Usage

### `des_inputs`

- The program will prompt for various inputs representing events in the system.
- Available events: `ls`, `rs`, `ws`, `lo`, `ro`, `lc`, `rc`, `glu`, `gll`, `gru`, `grl`, `exit`.
- Depending on the event, you may need to provide additional input such as `person_id` or `weight`.

### `des_display`

- Displays the status of the system each time a status update is received from `des_controller`.

### `des_controller`

- Operates the state machine to manage the control system. Responds to inputs from `des_inputs` and updates `des_display` accordingly.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **QNX Momentics IDE**: The project is developed in QNX, and the QNX Momentics IDE is required to build and run the project.
- **QNX Neutrino RTOS**: The code is intended to run on the QNX Neutrino real-time operating system.

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Project**: Download or clone the project from the repository.

2. **Import the Project into QNX Momentics**:
    - Open QNX Momentics IDE.
    - Create a new workspace named `cst8244_assign1`.
    - Import the project by selecting `File > Import... > General > Existing Projects into Workspace`.

3. **Build the Project**:
    - Ensure all projects (`des_display`, `des_controller`, `des_inputs`) are included in the workspace.
    - Clean and build all projects by selecting `Project > Clean...` and then `Project > Build All`.

4. **Copy the binary files** to the target machine's `/tmp` folder.

### Running the Project

1. **Start `des_display`**:
    ```
   cd tmp  
   ./des_display &
    ```
    - The `des_display` program will output its process ID when it starts running.


2. **Start `des_controller`**:
    ```
   cd tmp  
   ./des_controller <display_pid> &
    ```
    - Replace `<display_pid>` with the process ID of the `des_display` program obtained in step 1.


3. **Start `des_inputs`**:
    ```
   cd tmp  
   ./des_inputs <controller_pid>
    ```
    - Replace `<controller_pid>` with the process ID of the `des_controller` program obtained in step 2.
    - The `des_inputs` program will prompt you to enter various events to simulate the building entry controller system.


4. **Follow the prompts** to simulate various events and observe the system's behavior in the `des_display` terminal.

### Exiting the Programs

- To terminate the programs, enter `exit` as an event in the `des_inputs` program.

## State Machine Design

### Inputs

- **Card Scans**: Left (`ls`), Right (`rs`)
- **Door Status**: Left Open (`lo`), Left Closed (`lc`), Right Open (`ro`), Right Closed (`rc`)
- **Guard Actions**: Guard Left Unlock (`glu`), Guard Left Lock (`gll`), Guard Right Unlock (`gru`), Guard Right Lock (`grl`)
- **Weight Scale**: Weight Scale (`ws`)

### Outputs

- **Door Actions**: Open/Close/Lock/Unlock doors based on the state transitions.
- **Display Updates**: Send messages to the `des_display` program to update the current state.

### States

- **OUTSIDE**: Person is outside the building.
- **GETIN**: Person is entering the building.
- **INSIDE**: Person is inside the building.
- **GETOUT**: Person is exiting the building.

### State Transitions

- Transitions occur based on events such as card scans, door status changes, and guard actions. The state machine ensures that only one person can be in the lock at a time and that all doors are properly controlled.

### Error Handling

- The system remains in its current state when an invalid event is received, waiting for the correct input to transition to the next state.


## Sample scenarios

### Scenario 1: Entering the Building

This scenario represents a person entering the building, beginning with a left scan (`ls`) of the personâ€™s ID:

```
ls 12345 
glu  
lo  
ws 123  
lc  
gll  
gru  
ro  
rc  
grl  
exit
```

* The person scans their card at the left scanner (ls).    
* The person scans their card at the left scanner (ls).    
* The person scans their card at the left scanner (ls).    
* The controller checks if all doors are locked and closed.    
* The guard unlocks the left door (glu), and the person enters.    
* The person steps on the scale (ws).    
* The left door closes and locks (lc, gll).        
* The right door unlocks (gru), the person exits
